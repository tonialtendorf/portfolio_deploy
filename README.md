# altendorf_portfolio

## Description

- The challenge was to create a portfolio from scratch with no starter code using react. This project was built to start as my next round of a portfolio in class and to share out post completing the bootcamp.
- I learned how to use everything that I have learned and my resources in class to make this portfolio come to life.

## Installation
NA


## Usage

This portfolio can be used to review all my top accomplishments throughout the bootcamp such as my modules, challenges, and projects. This portfolio can also be provided to future employers to review my work and for further connections.
